# Python Variables - Example Program

num1=10
num2=20
sum=num1+num2

print(sum)

#Let's take another example on variable in Python. In this example, program will ask to the user to enter some detail to fetch the input and output accordingly as shown below.

variable_input = input("Who are you ? ")
print("Hello, "+variable_input)
input_variable = input("What is your name ? ")
print("You are "+input_variable)
var = input("Why are you here ? ")
print("You are here to "+var)


#Here is an example program, uses three variables in python namely m, n, and r

m=54
n=45
r=m+n
print("sum = ", r)
r=m-n
print("Subtract = ", r)
r=m*n
print("Multiply = ", r)
r=m/n
print("Divide = ", r)
