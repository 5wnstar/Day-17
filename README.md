VARIABLES IN PYTHON



Variables in Python, are the reserved memory locations to store the values in a Python program. It means that, whenever you are creating a variable in Python programming, you are reserving some space in the memory for that variable.
Create a Variable in Python

To create a variable and assign some values to it, follow the given syntax or general form in Python.

variable_name = "value to be assign";

You can also say that the above statement is called as assignment statement.

The above general form of creating a variable in Python, creates a variable called variable_name and assigns a value to it, the value is value to be assign.


Based on variable's data type, python interpreter allocates the memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory.

In Python, when you directly initialize an integer value to a Python variable, then that variable can be called as integer type variable at that time, and when you initialize floating-point value to the same variable, then at that time, that variable can be called as floating-point type variable.
